Both educational & invigorating, our goal is to make you want to see more of the museums afterwards! Good for family travel (a father and mother splitting with a kid per team), office team-building, hen/stag/birthday parties and study abroad school orientations, we can host hunts from 3 people to 200!\",\n",
